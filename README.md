# MLPerfâ„¢ Tiny Deep Learning Benchmarks for Embedded Devices

The goal of MLPerf Tiny is to provide a representative set of deep neural nets
and benchmarking code to compare performance between embedded devices. Embedded
devices include microcontrollers, DSPs, and tiny NN accelerators.  These devices
typically run at between 10MHz and 250MHz, and can perform inference using less
then 50mW of power.

MLPerf Tiny submissions will allow device makers and researchers to choose the
best hardware for their use case, and allows hardware and software vendors to showcase their
offerings.

The reference benchmarks are provided using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM).
Submitters can directly use the TFLM, although submitters are encouraged to use the software stack that works best on their hardware.

For the current version of the benchmark under development, please see the [benchmark folder](https://github.com/mlcommons/tiny/tree/master/benchmark). The next submission round is expected in Q3 2022 (date not yet finalized).

Previous versions are frozen using git tags as follows:

| Version | Code                                        | Release Date | Results                                     |
