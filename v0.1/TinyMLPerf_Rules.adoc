== Overview

This document describes how to implement one or more benchmarks in the TinyMLPerf
Inference Suite and how to use those implementations to measure the performance
of an ML system performing inference.

There are seperate rules for the submission, review, and publication process for all MLPerf benchmarks https://github.com/mlperf/policies/blob/master/submission_rules.adoc[here].

The MLPerf name and logo are trademarks. In order to refer to a result using the
MLPerf name, the result must conform to the letter and spirit of the rules
specified in this document. The MLPerf organization reserves the right to solely
determine if a use of its name or logo is acceptable.

=== Definitions (read this section carefully)

The following definitions are used throughout this document:

A _sample_ is the unit on which inference is run. E.g., an image, or a sentence.

_Quality_ always refers to a model’s ability to produce “correct” outputs.

A _system under test_ consists of a defined set of hardware and software
resources that will be measured for performance.  The hardware resources may
include processors, accelerators, memories, disks, and interconnect. The
software resources may include an operating system, compilers, libraries, and
drivers that significantly influences the running time of a benchmark.

A _reference implementation_ is a specific implementation of a benchmark
provided by the MLPerf organization.  The reference implementation is the
canonical implementation of a benchmark. All valid submissions to the closed division
of a benchmarkmust be *equivalent* to the reference implementation.

A _run_ is a complete execution of a benchmark implementation on a system under
the control of the load generator that consists of completing a set of inference
queries, including data pre- and post-processing, meeting a quality requirement
 in accordance with the division.

A _run result_ consists of the scenario-specific metric.

== General rules

The following rules apply to all benchmark implementations.

=== Strive to be fair

Benchmarking should be conducted to measure the framework and system performance
as fairly as possible. Ethics and reputation matter.

=== System and framework must be consistent

The same system and framework must be used for a suite result or set of
benchmark results reported in a single context.

=== Benchmark implementations must be shared

Source code used for the benchmark implementations must be open-sourced under a
license that permits a commercial entity to freely use the implementation for
benchmarking. The code must be available as long as the results are actively
used.

=== Non-determinism is restricted

The only forms of acceptable non-determinism are:

* Floating point operation order

* Random traversal of the inputs

* Rounding

All random numbers must be based on fixed random seeds and a deterministic random
number generator. The deterministic random number generator is the Mersenne Twister
19937 generator ([std::mt19937](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/random/mt19937/)).
The random seeds will be announced two weeks before the benchmark submission deadline.

=== Benchmark detection is not allowed

The framework and system should not detect and behave differently for
benchmarks.

=== Input-based optimization is not allowed

The implementation should not encode any information about the content of the
input dataset in any form.

=== Replicability is mandatory

Results that cannot be replicated are not valid results.

=== Audit Process

In depth audits will not be conducted in this version (V0.1) of TinyMLPerf


== Scenarios

TinyMLPerf only supports the Single Stream scenario in this version (V0.1).

== Benchmarks

==== Constraints for the Closed division

The suite includes the following benchmarks:

|===
|       Use Case       |                   Description                   |          Dataset          |       Model      | Quality Target 
|   Keyword Spotting   |        Small vocabulary keyword spotting        |      Speech Commands      |      DS-CNN      |   90% (Top 1)
|   Visual Wake Words  |           Binary image classification           | Visual Wake Words Dataset |     MobileNet    |   80% (Top 1)
| Image Classification |            Small image classification           |          Cifar10          |      ResNet      |   85% (Top 1)
|   Anomaly Detection  | Detecting anomalies in machine operating sounds |          ToyADMOS         | Deep AutoEncoder |   0.85 (AUC)
|===

==== Relaxed constraints for the Open division

1. An Open benchmark must perform a task matching an existing Closed benchmark, and be substitutable in LoadGen for that benchmark.
1. The accuracy dataset must be the same as an existing Closed benchmark.
1. Accuracy constraints are not applicable: instead the submission must report the accuracy obtained.
1. An open submission must be classified as "Available", "Preview", or "Research, Development, or Internal". See the https://github.com/mlcommons/policies/blob/master/submission_rules.adoc#73-results-categories[submission rules] for more information on these classifications.
1. The model can be of any origin (trained on any dataset, quantized in any way, and sparsified in anyway).

== Benchmark Runner

=== EEMBC ULPMark™-ML and MLCommons TinyMLperf Runner
The benchmark suite is run using the EEMBC ULPMark™-ML and MLCommons TinyMLperf Runner, which detects the DUT, sends inputs, and reads outputs over UART.

The alpha version of the runner is available here: https://github.com/eembc/alpha-runner

Note: The same code must be run for both the accuracy and performance Runner modes.

== Divisions

There are two divisions of the benchmark suite, the Closed division and the Open
division.

=== Closed Division

The Closed division requires using pre-processing, post-processing, and model
that is equivalent to the reference or alternative implementation.  The closed
division allows calibration for quantization and does not allow any retraining.

The unqualified name “MLPerf” must be used when referring to a Closed Division
suite result, e.g. “a MLPerf result of 4.5.”

=== Open Division

The Open division allows using an arbitrary training dataset, training script, or model.
The qualified name “MLPerf Open” must be used when
referring to an Open Division suite result, e.g. “a MLPerf Open result of 7.2.”

Pre- and Post-processing are not timed in V0.1 of the benchmark and are therefore 
can not be changed.

== Data Sets

For each benchmark, MLPerf will provide pointers to:

* An accuracy data set, to be used to determine whether a submission meets the
  quality target, and used as a validation set

* A speed/performance data set that is a subset of the accuracy data set to be
  used to measure performance

For each benchmark, MLPerf will provide pointers to:

* A calibration data set, to be used for quantization (see quantization
  section), that is a small subset of the training data set used to generate the
  weights

The dataset must be unchanged at the start of each run.

=== Pre- and post-processing

Pre- and post-processing is untimed for all benchmarks.

Pre- and post-processing must be the same as the reference implementation, except in the open division of Keyword Spotting where there are three options provided for pre-processing.

== Model

CLOSED: MLPerf provides a reference implementation of each benchmark. The benchmark implementation must use a model that is
equivalent, as defined in these rules, to the model used in the reference implementation.

OPEN: The benchmark implementation may use a different model to perform the same
task. Retraining is allowed.

=== Weight Definition and Quantization

CLOSED: MLPerf will provide trained weights and biases in fp32 format for both
the reference and alternative implementations.

MLPerf will provide a calibration data set for all models. 
Submitters may do arbitrary purely mathematical, reproducible quantization
using only the calibration data and weight and bias tensors from the benchmark
owner provided model to any numerical format
that achieves the desired quality. The quantization method must be publicly
described at a level where it could be reproduced.

To be considered principled, the description of the quantization method must be
much much smaller than the non-zero weights it produces.

Calibration is allowed and must only use the calibration data set provided by
the benchmark owner. Submitters may choose to use only a subset of the calibration data set.

Additionally, MLPerf may provide an INT8 reference for all models.

OPEN: Weights and biases must be initialized to the same values for each run,
any quantization scheme is allowed that achieves the desired quality.

=== Model Equivalence

All implementations are allowed as long as the accuracy bounds are
met and the reference weights are used. Reference weights may be modified
according to the quantization rules.

Examples of allowed techniques include, but are not limited to:

* Arbitrary frameworks and runtimes: TensorFlow lite for microcontrollers, CMSIS-NN, Micro TVM
  etc, provided they conform to the rest of the rules

* Running any given control flow or operations on or off an accelerator

* Arbitrary data arrangement

* Different in-memory representations of inputs, weights, activations, and outputs

* Variation in matrix-multiplication or convolution algorithm provided the
  algorithm produces asymptotically accurate results when evaluated with
  asymptotic precision

* Mathematically equivalent transformations (e.g. Tanh versus Logistic, ReluX
  versus ReluY, any linear transformation of an activation function)

* Approximations (e.g. replacing a transcendental function with a polynomial)

* Processing queries out-of-order within discretion provided by scenario

* Replacing dense operations with mathematically equivalent sparse operations

* Hand picking different numerical precisions for different operations

* Fusing or unfusing operations

* Mixture of experts combining differently quantized weights

* Stochastic quantization algorithms with seeds for reproducibility

* Dead code elimination

* Incorporating explicit statistical information about the calibration set
  (eg. min, max, mean, distribution)

* Empirical performance and accuracy tuning based on the performance and accuracy
  set (eg. selecting numerics experimentally)
  
* Sorting an embedding table based on frequency of access in the training set.
  (Submtters should include in their submission details of how the ordering was
  derived.)

The following techniques are disallowed:

* Wholesale weight replacement or supplements

* Discarding non-zero weight elements, including pruning

* Caching queries or responses

* Coalescing identical queries

* Modifying weights during the timed portion of an inference run (no online
  learning or related techniques)

* Weight quantization algorithms that are similar in size to the non-zero
  weights they produce

* Hard coding the total number of queries

* Incorporating explicit statistical information about the performance or
  accuracy sets (eg. min, max, mean, distribution)

* Techniques that only improve performance when there are identical
  samples in a query.

== FAQ

Q: Do I have to use the reference implementation framework?

A: No, you can use another framework provided that it matches the reference in
the required areas.

Q: Do I have to use the reference implementation scripts?

A: No, you don’t have to use the reference scripts. The reference is there to
settle conformance questions - with a few exceptions, a submission to the closed
division must match what the reference is doing.

Q: Can I submit a single benchmark (e.g., Visual Wake Words) or do I have to submit all benchmarks?

A: You can submit any of the benchmarks that are interesting, from just one benchmark to the entire set of benchmarks.

Q: For my submission, I am going to use a different model format (e.g., ONNX vs
TensorFlow Lite).  Should the conversion routine/script be included in the
submission? Or is it sufficient to submit the converted model?

A: The goal is reproducibility, so you should include the conversion
routine/scripts.

Q: Can we give the driver a hint to preload the image data to somewhere closer to the accelerator?

A: No.

Q: Can we preload image data somewhere closer to the accelerator that is mapped into host memory?

A: No.

Q: Can we preload image data in host memory somewhere that is mapped into accelerator memory?

A: Yes, provided the image data isn't eventually cached on the device.
